001 Templates and EJS
- Template means dynamic page : ejs or jade ...
- res.send() can give us html code returning to user but obviously it's a bad idea to
put all html code here
-> Solution: res.render('somewhere.html')
-> another problem: html is just a static page
-> Solution: ejs comes in -> we can put use js in html file (embeded js) -> can reused many times
res.render('somepage.ejs') -> when we render file, server first look at "views" folder and look for the file, then return to the user
- ejs is a package -> install : npm install ejs --save -> dont have to include by calling require something

- How we can give information for ejs file ? -> render function can take second argument as a object
key:value -> value here is what we want to send to ejs file, key is the identifier that used to call that value
- In ejs file , we use syntax similar as Java (jsp) to embed js code to html code: <%= key%>
