001 Unit Objectives
  - common font and text properties using CSS
  - include external fonts
  - box-model concepts
  - 3 projects : tic-tac-toe, image portfolio site, html+css blog

002 Text and Fonts
  - Font family, font size, font weight, line height, text align, text decoration
  -> http://www.cssfontstack.com/
  - font-family: Arial, Georgia -> built-in fonts, limited, depend on machine
  - font-size: 200px || ems -> relative font size (dynamic)
  2.0em -> double the size of the the parent element, not explicitly value 
  default size of browser is 16px , so 1em = 16px (if we haven't set font-size anywhere)
  
003 More Text and Fonts
  -> font-weight: how bold (thick) the text are, value can be : bold, normal or number 100 - 800, 800 is heaviest
  -> line-height: space between line, normally from 1.5 to 2
  -> text-align: right, center, left
  -> text-decoration: underline, line-through

004 Using Google Fonts
  https://fonts.google.com
  -> include (online or file locally) and using

005 Box Model
  - *IMPORTANT CONCEPT*
  -> every element has a box around it -> style properties on them
  -> 4 parts of box that we can manipulate
    + Content: blue part when hover the mouse over it (Chrome inspector)
    + Padding: space between border and content(text)
    + Border
    + Margin: space between the border and anything else outside
    -> add space between elements (2 images for example)
  - using width, height (px or %) to change size of content of element
  p {height: 50%} -> size of "content" is 50% of size of parent   
  - padding: 10px -> increase padding of 4 sises by 10px -> green part (chrome inspector)
  - margin: -> orange part with chrome inspector
  margin: 0 auto 0 auto -> element now is in center OR -> margin: 0 auto;

006 Create Tic Tac Toe Board
  -> div is block element (automatically starts a new line and takes its own line), so how to put multiple div elements in the same line?
  Answer: 1. reduce its content size -> 2. float: left that div element (change default setting)
  -> there are little space that is created automatically by browser between image element (image is inline element)
  How to get rid of it? float : left -> solve this problem
