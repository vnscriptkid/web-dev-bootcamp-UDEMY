001 What is Database

002 Installing MongoDB

003 Mongo Shell Basics

004 Intro to Mongoose Part 1
- What is mongoose: package from npm, help us interact with mongodb from nodejs
simplify the process of interacting with db
- define schema is a way we say what pattern of data we want to add to db (structured data in this case)
though mongo can handle unstructured data (unpredictable data)
var catSchema = new mongoose.Schema({}); -> Schema() takes in a object contains key-value pairs
that are corresponding to (name of column : type of column) in db
- Next step: 
var Cat = mongoose.model('Cat', catSchema);
-> what we do here: takes in
+ singular noun : represent a entity of "cats" collection (table) in MongoDB 
+ catSchema : is pattern of data that we want to add to DB (a way to structure input data to db)
_IMPORTANT: Actually, what we return from this model function is a MODEL
that has methods to interact with db : like Cat.find({}, function(err, cats){})
-> here first arg is a black object because we want to get all of cats from db, cats here is array return from db
- Cat.create({}, callback) -> create a new instance of cat model and adds it in db

- We can create a object (instance) of MODEL by : new Cat({}); 
-> this is a object that contains all properties of catSchema 
and methods like : save -> save this object to db , for example (this method is same as Cat.create()) 
                                                                                    
-> NOTICE: All the methods may need a call-back function to check (not mandatory) if process of executing methods error
2 arguments can be passed in is : err and the object if the methods is executed correctly
