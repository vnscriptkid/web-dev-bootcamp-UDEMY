001 Flash Messages Installation
- What is Flash? It' just kind of message that is displayed when user perform a action
like login, logout, adding camp ... to inform that state of that action (whether it is succeed or fail)
- We'll use module 'connect-flash': npm install connect-flash --save
- Include: var flash = require('connect-flash')
-> app.use(flash());
- express-session is prerequisite. See previous lectures
- We put the flash in the middleware before redirect to where (so the flash message is taken along)
