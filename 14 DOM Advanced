001 Introduction to Events
  - Event: when we click, hover, drag, press ... something -> something happens
  - PROCESS : Select element -> Attach event to selected element (add event listener)
  - Syntax : element.addEventListener(type, functionToCall) -> type here is type of event
  -> function here is a callback -> every time the event occur -> this function is called  
  - We can use loop do add many event listeners
  
002 Color Toggle Exercise
2 ways to complete this task: 
- Create a variable isPurple to check current state -> change to other state: isPurple = !isPurple
- select element -> classlist -> toggle -> a class predefined

003 Score Keeper Project
  - Using event change for the input type number
  
004 Other types of events
  - Lot of stuff here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events
  - 2 popular events : mouseover -> catch the event that mouse over the element
                       mouseout -> opposite above
  - We can use a loop to loop through a list of elements (li for example)
  - Using keyword this inside anonymous function of addEventListener, refers to current element that we're adding event
  
  - AGAIN, We dont want JS style every elements individually, other than that, we want to predefine style in css, then use JS to add
  style (class) for element by something like : this.classList.add("selected");
