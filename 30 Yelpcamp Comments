001 Yelpcamp Refactoring App
Put database things to a seperated file in "models" folder
Beside "Camp" model that we've already created , we make another model called "Comment" and link it to app.js by module.exports

002 Yelpcamp Seeding the database 
We'll use a seeds.js file to seed the database, this file include model Camp and define a function seedDB()
This function then is export by module.exports . So other file can call to this function

003 Yelpcamp Comment Model
- Create a new model Comment by first define commentSchema with 2 attributes:
+ author : String
+ text : String
-> Then: module.exports = mongoose.model('Comment', commentSchema);

- Change postSchema a little to associate with Comment model by id reference
add a attribute "comments" -> comments : [
                                {
                                  type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
                                  ref: "Comment"
                                }
                              ]
-> This means we have comments is a array, each element is a reference to Comment by id
