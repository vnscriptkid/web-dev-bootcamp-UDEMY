001 Intro to DOM
  -> Combine JS and HTML+CSS: JS interact with HTML , make things interactive
  - Why you should care:  games, form validations, animation ...
  -> to sum up: interactivity  
  
002 Defining DOM
  - Document Object Model
  - interface between JS and HTML+CSS
  - How DOM is contructed: 
    + browser turns every HTML tag into Javascript object that we can manipulate
    + everything is stored inside of the document object
  - how to see it ? in console, type document
  then console.dir(document)

003 SELECT and MANIPULATE
  - choose something and make it do something
  var h1 = document.querySelector("h1"); -> select
  h1.style.color = "pink" -> manipulate
  
  - very fun example to illustrate power of DOM
  change background of body after 1 second 
  remember how ? setInterval() function takes 2 argument
  one is anonymous function and second is time in miliseconds between each call

004 Important Selector Methods
  - document.somthing : document.body, document.head
  - Methods : 
  + document.getElementById() -> one id only occur only one time per page
  + document.getElementsByClassName() -> notice 's' -> return a list (not array?!?) even one element
  -> can access by [index], but we can't use forEach because it's not array???
  -> each element in the list returned is a object
  
  + document.getElementsByTagName()-> same above, take in a tag name
  
  + document.querySelector() -> css-style selector, only gives us first instance that it encounters
  -> very important to note -> return a object (ONLY ONE)
  Argument something like ".bold", "#special", "li a.special"
  When to use ? Example case : when we want to select body 
  + in case of getElementByTagName , it returns a list -> have to access element
  + with this method, we right away get the object
  
  + document.querySelectorAll() -> works same as querySelector (CSS-style selector) but return a all result it find in a list
  each element again is a object
