001 Compare Objects and Array

002 Intro to Objects
  - Inside curly bracket always is object in JS
  - A way to model a group of data that related to each other 
  - Example object person has name, age, cellphone... (all belongs to a person)
  - object dont have any built-in function like array
  - Retrieve data from object: 2 ways
    + bracket -> object["name of property here"]
    + dot notation
    -> when to use each one: 
    + if property starts with number -> can't use dot notation, it's not valid
    + if property name has space in it -> have to use square bracket
    + inside the square bracket can be a variable that store name of property
    but after dot notation must be name of property explicitly
    
003 Nested Objects and Array
  - objects can be a element in array, and on the other hand, array can be nested object
  - example posts array contains lists of post  
  - we often use them in conjunction to each other
