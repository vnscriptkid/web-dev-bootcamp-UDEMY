001 Intro to YelpCamp new Features
  - flash message : you see it one time not always (after successful registration)
  - option to edit and delete a campground (just owner can do these things)
002 Campground Edit and Update
  - need some new routes: 
    + campgrounds/:id/edit  using GET method -> show the edit form (EDIT)
    + campgrounds/:id       using PUT method -> making the changes in db (UPDATE)
  - To use these ROUTES , we must install method-override method in app.js
  var methodOverride = require('method-override');
  app.use(methodOverride('_method')); 
  Remember: Client can't use methods like PUT so there must be a mechanism that finally the method is changed to PUT
  So we add a params _method=something to the request. So method-override will change the method of request to whatever something
  is equal to , before sending to route for processing
  
  + The first route render a form that similar to creating a new camp but with data is filled
  we must findById with id from params to check if id is existed. if yes we generate a form 
  otherwise, just redirect to /campgrounds (camp/index.ejs)
  
  + The second route is responsible for updating from database.
  Rather than findById then Update we can just simply findByIdAndUpdate()
  with 3 params
    + first: id from param -> req.params.id
    + second: the updated camp (that we take from form)
    + third is callback
    
    => Now , everything seems done but Anyone is able to update the camp
    What we want is just the owner of camp has the right to edit and delete camp
  
003 Campground Destroy
- The logic is quite the same as UPDATE
- In show camp page, we add a form that method=POST and action="campgrounds/<%=camp._id%>?_method=DELETE"
- In the camp ROUTES , we add a route that process the coressponding actions above
This route uses delele method like : router.delete()
- We use a combination function : findByIdAndDelete
-> This function just take id from params and a call back
-> Either if the error occurs or not, both cases we redirect to the index page
