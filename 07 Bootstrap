001 Unit Objectives
  -> Make really good-looking site
  - 1: What and Why use it
  - 2: Include locally OR using CDN
  - 3: Use common Bootstrap components like navs and buttons
  - 4: layout using bootstrap grid system
  -> Project: Portfolio Site
  -> Project: Startup Landing Page

002 What is bootstrap?
  - Bootstrap homepage: http://getbootstrap.com/
  - HTML, CSS, JavaScript Framework -> someone's else code
  - Single CSS file + single JavaScript file  

003 Adding Bootstrap to a Project
  - 2 main choices: 
    + download bootstrap , include bootstrap.css in css folder
    + include online CDN version
  - Apply with button: 
  class="btn btn-danger btn-xs" -> btn-danger: red color 
  class="btn btn-success btn-xs active" -> active : current page
  class="btn btn-success btn-xs disabled"  
  btn-xs -> extra small size ;
  
  -> btn can be applied with anchor tag <a>:
  <a href="http://www.getbootstrap.com" class="btn btn-info btn-lg">Bootstrap Docs</a>
  : btn-info-> blue color ; btn-lg -> large;

004 Forms and Inputs
  - Note when using Bootstrap: Don't try to expert in memorization
  - Jumbotron : key content
  - Example: Create a div that has class="jumbotron" , a heading h1, a paragraph
  a button that class = "btn btn-success btn-lg"
  Put a div that has class="container" , so all inside container is centered
  
  -> Forms: 
  .form-group group elements together, add some space between groups
  .form-control -> without it my form looks very inferior
  -> 2 main important class
  
  -> Another type of form : form-inline 
  Form in one line that all style are controlled by this class  

005 Nav Bars
  -> CUSTOMIZED NAVBAR
  - <nav class="navbar navbar-default"></nav>
  -> Above line create a bar that contains all the things like button that is clickable to go somewhere
  -> Inside this nav element can be : 
    + may be one clickable div (a tag inside) that redirect to the homepage (put at the left most of the bar)
    This div has class = "navbar-header"
    + ul that has class = "nav navbar-nav" contains some li
    each li contains one a tag that redirect to categories of the page
    + may be another ul, also has class = "nav navbar-nav navbar-right"
    -> add class navbar-right
    This ul contains 2 li , each li contain a tag that links to Login and Sign-up page
    
  -> USING DEFAULT NAVBAR FROM HOMEPAGE
  Some features doesn't work without javascript
  You have to include also JQUERY before include bootstrap.js because bootstrap.js rely on JQUERY
  <div class="collapse navbar-collapse" id="bs-example-navbar-collapse-1">
  Everything inside above line is dissappear when in mobile device
  Now, adding the hamburger button and make it work
  Put the following line inside the div that has class="navbar-header"
  
  <button type="button" class="navbar-toggle collapsed" data-toggle="	collapse" data-target="#bs-example-navbar-collapse-1" aria-expanded="false">
		        <span class="sr-only">Toggle navigation</span>
		        <span class="icon-bar"></span>
		        <span class="icon-bar"></span>
		        <span class="icon-bar"></span>
	</button>  
  -> Here, data-target is important, the value has to be the same id of the div that has class="collapse navbar-collapse"
  Notice value of data-target has a # ahead

006 The grid system
  - Number 12 very important , corresponding to 12 units
  - Need container class outside
  - A div class row that wrap columns inside it
  - Each column belongs to class = "col-lg-1 pink" -> number here is 1 unit
  -> Now we've already known how to devide your site, but it still looks inferior -> next video	

007 The grid system part 2
  - divide site into parts dynamically depend on size of screen
  - 4 different sizes
  + col-lg-<number>	->large
  + col-md-<number>	->medium
  + col-sm-<number>	->small
  + col-xs-<number>	->extra small
  - nested grid (even nested grid has its own 12 units)
