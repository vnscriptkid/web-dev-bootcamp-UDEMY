001 Refactoring Routes
mkdir routes
cd routes
touch campgrounds.js comments.js index.js
- In move all the routes from app.js to the corresponding files. The purpose of this is 
breaking down the big problem to smaller one. Each file will process all routes that related to a entity
- In each file rather than using app.protocol(...) , we create a router as following
var express = require('express');
var router = express.Router({mergeParams: true}); -> mergeParams is important when the route contains param, otherwise param will be null BE CAREFUL
                                                      BECAREFUL
Replace all the 'app' by router
At the end of the file, export router by: module.exports = router;
In our main file app.js , we want to link to these files : 
var campRoutes = require('../routes/camps');
app.use(campRoutes);

NOTICE: If the all routes in the same route file has the same sub route ahead, we can cut it and put in app.use
