004 HTML Boilerplate and Comments
  - something every HTML file have (underlying structure)
       -> <!DOCTYPE html> : html5
       -> head : something we dont in the page, metadata
       -> body : contents of page
       -> title : is important
       -> comment : <!-- this is a comment -->
       
005 Basic Tags
  -> h1, ... , h6 : decrease by size, s1 is biggest, h stands for heading
  every h tag have its own line, even we put them in the same line
  -> p : every in a p tag is in the same paragraph
  -> b : make something very "bold" . This is not the best way anymore
  Best way is using <strong></strong>
  -> i : make the text italic. Altertative way is "em" that stands for emphasize.
  -> Why <strong> and <em> is better?

006 HTML Lists
  -> 2 types: ordered list (numbered) and unordered list (bullet points)
  -> ol and ul , combines the elements together
  -> every elements in the list is inside <li> tags
  -> Nested list

    <a href="put link to another page here"> CLICK ME </a> 
    -> a tag is inline element, it means a tag doesn't take its own line
    -> need to make sure link is explicit, specifying http protocol

  * TRICK for Sublime: lorem + tab to create a arbitrary paragraph
