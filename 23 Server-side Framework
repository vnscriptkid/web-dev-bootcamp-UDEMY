001 Intro to Express
  - Web dev framework != library (stackoverflow for more)
  - Simplify common tasks 
  - Flexible, lightweight framework (but powerful)
  
002 First Express App
- To use framework, put a : require('express');
-> here this sentence actually is a function. So we have to call that funciton as: 
var app = require('express')(); 

003 The Package.json
- This file is created when type: npm init -> in project folder
- Contains information about project and version of all libraries that we install in file

004 Route params
- We use route to tell server what to do when user send a request
somthing like: app.use('/', function(){})
At least, 2 parameters which are : path and a callback function that is executed when the route is called
- When route is '*' , it means all routes -> normally put at the end to covers all cases 
- when route is something like /:subFolder/ -> here subFolder is a parameter , it can be many thing
To get this value from request of user -> req.params.param-name

005 Express Basics Exercise
- Requirements: 
+ /speak/pig -> print : "The pig says 'Oink'"
+ /speak/cow -> print : "The cow says 'Moo'"
+ /speak/dog -> print : "The dog says 'Woof Woof!'"
-> param here can be -> :animal
-> Observation: each animal have a particular sound
We may think of using a object that contains (key-value pairs)
key here is name of animal and value is sound of it: animals{name1:sound1,...}
Each time we want to get sound of it -> animals.name1 for example
