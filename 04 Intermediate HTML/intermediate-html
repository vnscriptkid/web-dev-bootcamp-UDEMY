001 Unit objectives
  - Write valid HTML Tables
  -> Exercise 1 : Pokemon table
  - HTML Forms: form, input, select, label tags
  -> Exercise 2 : Recreate complex form
  
002 HTML Tables
  - table using tr and td, which stand for table row and table data, to create table
  - th used to make header of the table
  - thead and tbody can be used to differentiate between header and content, though nothing change in appearing but it is more meaningful
  - Add to table tag a attribute border="1" to show the border

003 Exercise: Pokemon Table

004 HTML Forms
  - Getting user input
  - Objectives: form , input, label, form validations
  - 2 attributes of form : 
    + action: where to send data to
    + method: type of http request: GET OR POST
      GET: searching (defalt method) -> data appears in address bar
      POST: add something to database like login or sign up
  - input tag : a lot of different types like text, password, color, radio,...

005 Playing with Inputs
  - 2 ways to submit:
    <button>Submit</button>
    <input type"submit">Submit</input>
    -> identical things
  - Attribute placeholder="username" can be added to the input tag to lets user know what input is
  - form tag is something like a container that combine all input inside that into data form
  - Attribute name is added to input tag to server can retrieve from that form
  
006 Label
  - Something like captions that explains what input tag is
  - 2 ways to use label
    + input is nested inside label tag
    + better way is to separate label and input by adding "id" for input and "for" for label to specify which input that label belongs to

007 Form Validation
  - Put some conditions (constraints) for the input
  - Share just a LITTLE responsibility with server, not everything (why? these can be manipulated)
  - required used to ensure input is not black
  - Check format of data (correct format email) -> type = "email" instead of "text"
  
008 Dropdowns & Radio Button 
  - type="radio" -> Usually one choice, can't be unchecked just change ur choice (e.g. Gender)
    name attribute between all input in the same content of a form must be the same, so that they can be connected
    value attribute need to be specified
  - type="checkbox" -> Multiple Choice, Can be unchecked  
  
  - Using select tag to create dropdown menu
  - Many option tag is used inside select for different choices
  - One single name attribute for select tags
  - Each option tag has its own value attribute, otherwise whatever inside options is used for value
  
  - Textarea: multi-line input
  - Using rows and cols attributes to specify how wide and width textarea is
  - Still need a name attribute
