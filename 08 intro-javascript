001 Unit Objectives
  - Evaluate JS using developer console
  - 5 JS primitives
  - Define variables with var keyword
  - console.log, alert, prompt
  
002 JS Console  
  - Testing purpose
003 Prmitives
  - Numbers: 4 3.9 -10
  - Strings: "Hello World" "43" -> inside of quotes (single or double -> but must match)
    + concatenation
    + using blackslash to include quote inside a string without error
    -> but what if blackslash is in use (blackslash used to ignore special character after it)
    -> solution: used 2 blackslash -> return 1 blackslash
    -> s.length -> return how many characters string has
    -> access character using square bracket [] and index
    ex : "thanh"[0] -> "t"
         "thanh"[4] -> "h"
         "thanh"[5] -> undefined (make sense?)
    
  - boolean : true false
  - null undefined
  
004 Primitives Exercises
-> 100 % 3 -> 1
-> ("blah" + "blah")[6] -> "a"
-> "hello".length % "hi\\".length -> 5 % 3 -> 2

005 Variables
  - basic concept for every programming language
  deep level : name points to somewhere in memory
  - Define variable in JS: using var keyword
  - JS: dynamic typing (can change from one type to other type without problem)
  -> can be a problem in other language
  - convetion naming -> var isVisited = true; -> camelCase

006 Null and Undefined
  - undefined (have no value but already declared)
  - null : nothing (sound similar :)) -> check it out)
  -> maybe null is a type of value ?!? means nothing
  -> again , undefined is no value at all
  
007 Useful build-in method
  -> alert -> browser pops up a box 
  -> prompt -> get input from user, can be assigned a variable
  -> console.log -> print to the console
  
  Bonus: clear() -> clear console , a method

008 JS in seperated file
  - html using script tag to link to js file, script tag can be placed in body or head
  - load html -> code run
